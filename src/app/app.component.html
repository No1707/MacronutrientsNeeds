    <h1>Your macronutrients needs</h1>
    <p>Macronutrients are the nutrients that provide us with the energy (measured in calories) needed by our bodies for
      growth,
      metabolism and other functions. The prefix “macro” means large; macronutrients are needed in large quantities in
      contrast to micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). <br><br>

      <span>Carbohydrates</span>, <span>proteins</span> and <span>fats</span> make up the group of macronutrients. Let
      us take a moment to briefly look at each of
      these macronutrients.</p>

      <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
      <p>These are a major source of energy for our bodies and are stored in our muscles and liver for later use.Foods
        that contain large amounts of carbohydrates include fruits, grains (rice, oats, barley, etc) and roots
        (potatoes, yams, carrots, etc). <br> 1 gram of carbohydrate = 4 Calories</p>

    <div class="defContainer proteins revealRight">
      <p>Our bodies use proteins to grow tissue and muscle, repair organs and to create hormones and enzymes; proteins
        are also used for energy when carbohydrates are unavailable. Foods that contain high levels of protein include
        poultry, fish, beans, diary, nuts and legumes. <br> 1 gram of protein = 4 Calories</p>
      <h3>Proteins</h3>

    <div class="defContainer fats revealLeft">
      <h3>Fats</h3>
      <p>In order to absorb vitamins, our bodies need fats. Foods that contain a high percentage of fat include
        cooking oils, butter, nuts and cheese. Of the three macronutrients, fats contain the highest number of calories
        per gram. <br> 1 gram of fat = 9 Calories</p>

        <h2>First, we need to determine your <span>TDEE</span> <br>(Total Daily Energy Expenditure)</h2>

        <p>Your total daily energy expenditure is an estimation of how many calories you burn per day when exercise is
          taken into account. <br><br> Determining your caloric budget (the number of calories you can consume)
          positions you to be more successful
          with your fitness goals; knowing your caloric needs empowers you with the knowledge to employ a more practical
          and sustainable strategy to achieving your fitness goals.</p>

        <p>This calculation uses the <a target="blank" href="https://sympa-sympa.com/creation-bien-etre/une-formule-simple-calcule-combien-de-calories-par-jour-tu-devrais-consommer-pour-perdre-du-poids-307360/"><span>Mifflin-St Jeor</span></a> formula, which is the most used and precise method.</p>

    <h2>Then, what is your <span>goal</span> ?</h2>

    <p><span>Maintaining</span> your current body weight, will require roughly the TDEE you calculated above. To
      <span>gain</span> weight, you should
      exceed your TDEE and to <span>lose</span> weight you should create a caloric deficit by consuming less than your
      TDEE. You can create a caloric deficit by increasing your physical activity or consuming less than you TDEE.
      Please keep in mind that too large of a caloric deficit can lead to health issues or even compromise your
      weight-loss.</p>
